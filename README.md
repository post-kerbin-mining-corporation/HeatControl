## Features

A complete and total rebuild of my old Stockalike Station Parts Expansion project. Everything has been redone, and nothing is left of the old mod!

* **High Temperature Radiators:**  Versatile radiators in many form factors - fixed, deployable, wraparaound and more
* **Graphene Microchannel Radiators:** Giant, fragile radiators with excellent heat rejection
* **Heat Exchangers:** Specialized items that pull heat to them but do not radiate effectively - useful for moving heat around

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.2.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.20.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
