- Spanish translations courtesy of forum user fitiales

v0.4.1
------
- Fix description of EF-1K Microchannel Graphene Heat Radiator Panel

v0.4.0
------
- KSP 1.3
- Converted to KSP 1.3 localization
- Updated included MM to 2.8.0
- Updated MiniAVC to 1.0.3.3
- Normalized radiator naming - retractable radiators are xxR and fixed are xxF
- Added EBR-1000 and EBR-250 Heat Exchangers: pseudo-radiators that pull (non-core) heat to themselves for low electricity costs. High thermal masses.
- Added DR-8K Microchannel Graphene Heat Radiator: advanced heat radiator with great power to mass ratios. Does not rotate, not retractable
- Added DR-4K Microchannel Graphene Heat Radiator: half-sized DR-8K
- Added DF-2K Microchannel Graphene Heat Radiator Panel: Static heat radiator panel, surface attachable
- Added DF-1K Microchannel Graphene Heat Radiator Panel: similar to DF-2K but cut at a 45 degree angle
- Normalized High Temperature radiator surface area ratios: dissipated heat now more accurately conforms to surface area ratio
- Rebalanced mass and cost of all radiators to be consistent with new balance numbers from NFE
- Renamed all radiators to reflect their new heat transfer numbers
